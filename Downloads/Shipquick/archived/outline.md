Shipquick Project Brief - Document Outline
Let me present the comprehensive outline for the Shipquick.md document. This outline captures everything we've discussed and structures it for maximum clarity and implementation success.

PROPOSED DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
Section 1: Executive Summary and Vision
This opening section will explain what Shipquick is at its core, why it exists, and what problems it solves. It will clearly state that Shipquick is a meta-agentic system builder, meaning it's a system that generates other specialized agentic systems for any business goal. The vision section will articulate how Shipquick democratizes the creation of sophisticated multi-agent AI systems by providing a proven architectural framework that anyone can instantiate for their specific needs.
Section 2: Foundational Concepts and Terminology
This section will establish the vocabulary and mental models needed to understand Shipquick. It will define what we mean by agentic systems, explain the difference between orchestrators and specialist agents, clarify what workflows are and how they differ from simple task execution, define context layers and why they matter, and explain the concept of meta-systems that generate systems. Every term will be explained assuming the reader has no prior knowledge.
Section 3: The Architectural Philosophy
This section will dive deep into the three pillars that make Shipquick's architecture powerful. The first pillar is modular federation where systems are composed of independent but coordinated modules. The second pillar is hyper-specialization where each agent focuses narrowly on one domain for maximum depth. The third pillar is context-driven intelligence where the system accumulates knowledge over time and adapts behavior based on that knowledge. This section will explain why these principles matter and how they work together.
Section 4: The Critical Context Management System
This is perhaps the most important section because it addresses your key insight that anything not documented is forgotten. This section will detail the six context layers with complete schema designs. It will explain the User Profile Layer including all fields, data types, and relationships. It will cover the Goal and Context Layer showing how objectives get structured. It will detail the Progress and State Layer with timestamp and version tracking. It will explain the Session Context Layer for maintaining coherence within interactions. It will describe the Knowledge Graph Layer showing how concepts and artifacts connect. Finally, it will detail the Interaction History Layer with searchable records of all past activities.
For each layer, the documentation will include example data structures with IDs, timestamps, and version numbers. It will show how data flows between layers, how updates get tracked, and how queries retrieve relevant context. The section will emphasize that every piece of information must be treated as a concrete database entry with proper metadata.
Section 5: Data Persistence and Tracking Standards
This section will establish strict rules for how all data must be handled. It will mandate that every entity gets a unique identifier using a specified format. Every record must include creation timestamp, last modified timestamp, and version number. All updates must be append-only with full history maintained. Relationships between entities must be explicitly tracked with relationship IDs. The section will provide concrete examples showing how to track a user completing a workflow step, how to record an agent interaction with full context, and how to maintain versioned artifacts.
Section 6: Agent Architecture Specification
This section will detail exactly how agents are structured in Shipquick. It will explain the markdown file format with YAML frontmatter and XML instruction encoding. It will break down each component of an agent including the activation sequence with numbered steps, the persona definition with all required fields, the menu structure with command patterns, the menu handlers showing how different action types get executed, and the rules section that governs agent behavior.
The section will include a complete annotated template agent file showing every element. It will explain how agents access the context engine, how they update context during execution, and how they maintain their own state. Tree diagrams will show the agent lifecycle from activation through execution to dismissal.
Section 7: Workflow Architecture Specification
This section will detail the step-file architecture pattern that prevents hallucination and maintains discipline. It will explain why workflows are decomposed into micro-files with one step per file. It will detail the just-in-time loading pattern where only current steps are in memory. It will show how sequential enforcement prevents skipping or optimizing steps. It will explain the state tracking mechanism using frontmatter arrays. It will detail the append-only building pattern for document creation.
The section will include complete workflow templates showing the main workflow markdown file structure, the step file format with all required sections, and the continuation pattern using menus. It will provide a tree diagram showing how steps connect and how the executor navigates the workflow graph.
Section 8: The Master Orchestrator Design
This section will explain the brain of every Shipquick-generated system. It will detail how the orchestrator maintains awareness of all available agents through manifest files, how it routes requests to appropriate specialists based on context analysis, how it coordinates multi-agent collaboration, how it provides proactive suggestions based on progress patterns, and how it manages the overall user experience.
The section will show the orchestrator's decision-making logic with flowcharts. It will explain how natural language requests get parsed and mapped to capabilities. It will detail how context gets pre-loaded for workflows to create seamless experiences.
Section 9: Module Structure and Organization
This section will explain how Shipquick systems are organized into logical modules. It will show the typical module structure with agents, workflows, configurations, data files, and documentation. It will explain how modules remain independent while sharing common infrastructure. It will detail the manifest system that tracks all components. It will show how custom modules can be added without modifying core functionality.
Tree diagrams will illustrate the directory structure of a complete Shipquick system showing where each type of file lives and how they reference each other.
Section 10: The Meta-System: How Shipquick Generates Systems
This is the section that explains Shipquick's unique capability as a system that builds systems. It will detail the analysis phase where business goals get decomposed into required capabilities. It will explain the design phase where agent roles get architected. It will show the generation phase where actual files get created. It will detail the validation phase where generated systems get checked for completeness.
The section will walk through a complete example showing how Shipquick would analyze a business goal, determine what agents are needed, design their personas and capabilities, generate all required files, and validate the resulting system. This will be done with a generic example rather than the PM-specific one.
Section 11: Configuration and Customization Patterns
This section will explain how Shipquick systems get customized for specific users and contexts. It will detail the configuration file structures including user preferences, system settings, and domain-specific parameters. It will show how agents read and apply configuration at runtime. It will explain how systems adapt behavior based on configuration without code changes.
Section 12: Quality Standards and Feedback Loops
This section will explain how Shipquick systems maintain and improve quality over time. It will detail how quality standards get defined for specific domains. It will show how artifacts get assessed against standards automatically. It will explain how identified weaknesses generate improvement tasks. It will detail how feedback loops drive continuous improvement.
Section 13: Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration
This section will explain how agents work together effectively. It will detail the shared context mechanisms that enable coordination. It will show communication patterns for agent-to-agent handoffs. It will explain multi-agent collaboration modes like the party mode for group discussions. It will detail how agents contribute to collective intelligence without redundancy.
Section 14: Implementation Guide for Developers
This section will provide step-by-step instructions for someone implementing Shipquick. It will explain the development environment setup including required tools and dependencies. It will walk through creating the first agent from template. It will show how to implement the context engine with proper data structures. It will detail how to build the workflow executor that enforces step-file discipline. It will explain how to create the orchestrator with routing logic.
The section will include code structure suggestions, naming conventions, and implementation patterns that ensure consistency with the Shipquick architecture.
Section 15: Usage Patterns and Best Practices
This section will explain how to use Shipquick effectively once implemented. It will show how to instantiate a new system for a business goal. It will detail best practices for designing effective agent personas. It will provide guidelines for workflow decomposition. It will explain context management best practices. It will show common patterns for different types of goals like learning systems, productivity systems, creative systems, and analysis systems.
Section 16: Do's and Don'ts - Critical Rules
This section will be formatted as clear imperatives showing what must always be done and what must never be done. It will cover data persistence rules, workflow execution rules, agent behavior rules, context management rules, and system design rules. Each rule will include the rationale explaining why it matters and what breaks if the rule is violated.
Section 17: Data Relationships and Schema Reference
This section will provide complete schema documentation showing all entity types, their fields with data types, their relationships with cardinality, and their constraints. It will include entity-relationship diagrams showing how different pieces of the system connect. It will provide example queries showing how to retrieve related information efficiently.
Section 18: Troubleshooting and Debugging Guidance
This section will anticipate common issues and provide solutions. It will explain how to debug agents that aren't behaving correctly, how to fix workflows that get stuck, how to recover from context corruption, and how to resolve conflicts when agents disagree. It will provide diagnostic questions to identify root causes quickly.
Section 19: Extension and Customization Framework
This section will explain how to extend Shipquick beyond its core capabilities. It will show how to add new agent types, how to create custom workflow patterns, how to integrate external tools and APIs, and how to add new context layers for specific domains.
Section 20: Appendices and Reference Materials
This section will include complete templates ready to use, example systems showing Shipquick instantiated for different goals, a glossary of all terms used, a command reference for common operations, and a version history tracking Shipquick's evolution.

VISUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
The document will incorporate numerous visual aids including tree diagrams showing directory structures and component hierarchies, flowcharts showing decision logic and execution flows, entity-relationship diagrams showing data connections, sequence diagrams showing agent interaction patterns, state diagrams showing workflow progression, and architectural diagrams showing system layers and their relationships.

SPECIAL SECTIONS FOR MODEL TRAINING
Since this document needs to train a model to implement Shipquick, it will include explicit instructions written directly to the model including step-by-step implementation sequences, validation checkpoints after each phase, common pitfalls to avoid with explanations, success criteria for each component, and testing procedures to verify correct implementation.

THE DOCUMENT'S STRUCTURE SUMMARY
The document will flow from high-level vision down to specific implementation details. It will move from theory to practice progressively. Each section will build on previous sections with clear forward and backward references. The document will be self-contained requiring no external references to understand completely. Most importantly, the document will treat the model as an intelligent student who needs clear explanations, concrete examples, and strict guidance to implement correctly.

This outline captures everything we've discussed including the initial conversation about your PM needs, the BMAD analysis that inspired Shipquick, the gaps we identified and our solutions, the enhanced context architecture, your critical instruction about data persistence, and the meta-system capability. Every concept will be explained generally without PM-specific examples unless used purely for illustration.
