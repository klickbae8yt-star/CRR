- Use green/blue accent to show "future/possibility"

**SLIDE 7: The Passion Behind This**
- "This is what I've been building - not because anyone asked, but because I believe this is where enterprise AI needs to go."
- 6,000+ lines of production-ready architecture
- Working system, not a concept deck
