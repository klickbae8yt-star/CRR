# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a todo application project. The codebase is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

This project structure and technology stack have not yet been established. When implementing:

1. Determine the appropriate technology stack based on project requirements
2. Set up build tools, linters, and testing frameworks as needed
3. Update this file with specific build, test, and development commands once established

## Architecture

The architecture will be defined as the project develops. Key considerations for a todo application typically include:

- Task data model and storage layer
- User interface components for task management (create, read, update, delete)
- State management approach
- Data persistence strategy

Update this section once the architecture is established with specific patterns and conventions used in this codebase.
